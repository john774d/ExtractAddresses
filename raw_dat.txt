Finally, after a long time I joined the new CryptoCurrency Network telegram this time I followed the give away, happy to join in this group, adding my insight about mining and other coin, although I have not been able to mining using my laptop or pc because of spec its still below the standard (32bit) :( .. hehehe
But I am very happy to be in this group, sometimes I laugh myself, amazed to read the chat from all friends. Success for everything.

I've already won! Well, not the eth giveaway, but something far more valuable\u2014I've found this channel. Not only quite entertaining, but so far, a vast wealth of knowledge through a shared experience. A great journey into a world I so far am unable to explore so thoroughly on my own.
But just in case, here too is my address:

I am thinking.. we should be the one who giving u ethereum instead of you giveaway because you share so much mining experience with us. But still.. I think if I can be lucky enough to have your donations, I will keep the coin until one day the orphanage accepting crypto then I will give it to them.

Hey Man, good work on the giveaway.
Maybe wait and see how many entrants you have before you decide how many winners to pick.
I can also help you collect the data and use an online picker to choose the winners to ensure everybody gets an even chance.

For 1 Ethereum Give-away, Comment Down your ETH addresses as well as a short comment about channel and your thoughts. The give-away is for people who stay on channel and watch videos. Not just quickly leave your ETH address and go continue lurking youtube other videos. Stay, be subscriber, like, comment, then leave the wallet address. That's more fair than, if someone wins who just saw the Give-away title and left address then someone who is subsribed since beginning. Supporting Channel. I love fairness ! Thanks

Aligning the gpu's in circular structure so that heat from 1 gpu to another gpu will not flow like regular rectangular frame & you get extra space for more miners. what do you think about solar panel roof for your mining facility?

So the stuff you had to blur out, was that the other mining facility or the guard shack? You know, the two things you showed in detail in your previous videos, lol.

If you don't want to have to blur and edit so much, maybe have your camera guy just shoot from an angle that those areas aren't in frame.

Thanks. I will invest this Ethereum for school and mining! 

The channel is great and the site, have you thought of having a discussion/blog page? like this https://thebitcoin.pub/

hey man i was waiting for these video from very long time i am watching your videos from very beginning when you were going to setup the first mining rigs i love the way you setup your rigs the cooling system was cool i know you were having problems i really appreciate the giveway i have suggestions for ypu to grow as a viewer 
1) please buy something so that your camera will be stable 
2)please upload a update video as you get time at least 2 videos a week i really waits for your video
3) you was going to tell how you modified the psus of hp server made a video on that 
4 ) i really like watching videos in which you show yourself and your farm only videos with screen recorder it is kind boring little bit

good points 

1) you are really very down to ground man their are many farms but no one bother to share anything
2) takes advices from us about buy or not anything 
3) you are very transparent like you told true thing about genesis so thank you friend 


love watching your videos kepp it up thanks

Keep bringing update on the project ! i have a small farm with few anti miner \u00a0and very interested in seen details on electrical PDU distribution of 220V. also mostly how you will be doing the cooling ? i had to use fan duct to extract hot air outside building as blowing hot air inside and cooling it with AC is not efficient and lots ant miner are on. Also why are you bluring parts now, did you get some complain from bitfury? ETH :\u00a00xbCDD1BD3C0Dcb4a6946Ceb3815D5b2951FfeAE13

Depends on your electricity price.

If you have free electricity you will make around 7$ in profit daily (with todays price).

But this price changes everyday, as difficulty goes up and Dash price is quite steady.

I think you are best in region my friend! Not because i live in Georgia i have seen your farms and they are supper organized. i seen other farms in GEO there is not expensive energy in country \u00a0but there is no such max try for more perfection in other farms. you have all time everything clean and max time and energy usage everything perfect!

I am about to receive 5 free coins that could be the next Bitcoin and it was free.

If you just click on this link http://digitalfrontiernews.com/?affiliates=272 and register for the free information you will get 5 Cloud Coins that are activated. I don\u2019t know how long these coins are available so go register now. FYI, 5 free Bitcoins would be valued today at $35,000 at today's value.

I discovered today that I was cheated on purchasing an S9 + psu mining with an account, apparently violated with several positive feedbacks on other S9 sold, i lost 2 years of money put aside without going on vacation or at the bar or restaurant, for me there was a lot of money and sacrifices, my experience ends here, the money makes money the poor ones come back and they are also robbed.
I thought I'd do something and stuff with the bitcoins and instead I fucked up, in 25 years I've never had scammers I bought several times from China USA Russia but had problems, I paid it all at once!
I can not afford anything bitmain accepts payments only in BTco BCH etc. Customs customs inconsistencies and delivery schedules did not convince me having no bitcoin I should have changed by buying bitcoin.
Greetings and good work!

If you used that $6120 to buy and hold Bitcoin on July 11, 2017. It would be worth over $18,000 today. Your lending profit of $8,437 plus initial investment is only $14,557.

There is not trading bot. You are being paid with other people's investments. It's a Scam. Once people stop lending people stop earning.

They didn't remove any coins from circulation, it wasn't there in the first place. Bitconnect always had a limited circulating supply, partly because of stacking. What really happened a few days ago is that coinmarketcap was used to calculate every coin's capitalization by it's total supply and with those calculations bitconnect's market cap happened to surpass dash's and took it's place. Then people from dash got fearful and complained about it and coinmarketcap changed it's calculation method from total to cirtulating supply only for bitconnect coin, not for any other coin, not even for dash, which has a lot of supply locked into masternodes.
Also the way bitconnect makes most of their money is not by day trading. BCC coin price is tethered to bitcoin price by their own exchange. Look at the price charts and you will see they are quite similiar. They know long-term bitcoin is going to go up, so will their coin, that means they will always have enough money to pay customers as long as BTC continues to exist.

My friend you inspire. I'm a student in South Africa, and been watching since the old facility and have kept up with your videos ever since. You keep the process simple and your advice is great. I managed to buy myself a GTX 1050ti and am looking to start some mining. Any advice on which alt-coin would be good to start off with and also with software/program to use? I like the look of Monero but I'm not sure yet

It is not a scam. I dont have any refferal and i return all mine investemnts. Check yourself. If you are bussines man check yourself first. All of this people do not understand how work the business. This what happened with BCC is must happen to all other crypto. It is not correct for ALL coins, BTC for example they have many locked and losted coins that NEVER be recovered.

I think you got it a bit wrong ?

Coin Market Cap have taken out all 'Lent' BCC from the Circulating supply' as its locked up in loans its not circulating supply.

Bit connect themselves did not 'pocket' the drop in market cap, the calculation was just updated based on lend coins not being circulated. The only way the supply will increase is if people start holding their Bit connect coins rather than lending it on the platform.

It can also increase through mining. I don't think many people mine it though as it doesn't pay squat.
